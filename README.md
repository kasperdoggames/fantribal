# Fantribal

Fantribal is for music artists, bands and their fans to mint and buy NFTs that celebrate events in the lifetime of a fledgling artists. The sale of collectible NFTs provides valuable funds to support the early life of new artists. When they are famous there will be rewards for venues and fans through royalties from the sale of these ultimately valuable.

### How does it use NFTs?

NFTs are considered merchandise that fans can purchase to support their band. Currently images but opening up the possibilities of videos and music clips and using NFTs as tickets.

Bands can create their profile giving them them the opportunity to mint NFTs for their fans

Bands can customise their profile page by adding adding photos of the band before setting up their timeline page. This is the USP of FanTribal. Rather than a grid of NFTs we associate NFTs with key dates in the lifetime of the band. So an NFT that represents the genesis of a band is likely to be the most valuable when the band becomes famous. It also provides a much more visually pleasing way for NFT to represent the lifetime of a band.

### What's it build with?

The website is built on Next.js and uses Tailwindcss.

The website makes use of Mintbase SDK to provide NFT minting capabilities.

Band profile images are held on Filecoin/IPFS.
